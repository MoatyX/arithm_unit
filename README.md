# Bin_Calculator

A simple Hardware Unit written in VHDL that represents a 4 bit device that can do 4bit arithmatic operations.
as an end project to the course Digital Design at the Ernst Abbe Hochschule Jena.

The VHDL code was created and simulated using the software **ModelSim** Students Edition on **Windows** machines.

# Getting Started

Here is a guide on how to download this repo and start testing the code on Windows. we are not sure if on Linux would be different, but it should be the same.

1. Clone the repo normally to the desktop:

   this could be done in many ways. it can be downloaded as ZIP directly from GitHub or cloned using the Git Command Line Interface.
   here it is using the Git CLI:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/MoatyX/Bin_Calculator.git binary_4bit_arithmetic_unit`  

2. Open ModelSim. **_File_** -> **_New_** -> **_Project....._**
3. in the dialog: **_Project Name_**: call the project whatever. **_Project Location_**: choose the folder you cloned the VHDL code in. then click **OK**
4. after that click on **_Add Existing File_**, and choose all the cloned source VHDL files. click **OK**
5. Go **_Compile_** -> **_Compile All_**. and the code is ready to be tested. (Note: if compile errors occure, just compile all again or a couple of times and it will go away and show everything green)
